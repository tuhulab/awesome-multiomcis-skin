## Atopic Dermatitis

### Transcriptomics

- 2020 Feb - He - [Single-cell transcriptome analysis of human skin identifies novel fibroblast subpopulation and enrichment of immune subsets in atopic dermatitis](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.01.042) 
  - Single-cell
  - Fibroblasts demonstrated a novel COL6A5+COL18A1+ subpopulation that was unique to lesional AD, and expressed CCL2 and CCL19 cytokines. A corresponding LAMP3+ dendritic cell (DC) population that expressed the CCL19 receptor CCR7 was also unique to AD lesions, illustrating a potential role for fibroblast signaling to immune cells. Lesional AD samples were characterized by expansion of inflammatory DCs (CD1A+FCER1A+) and tissue resident memory T-cells (CD69+CD103+). The frequencies of type 2 (IL13+)/type 22 (IL22+) T-cells were higher than type 1 (IFNG+) in lesional AD, while this ratio was diminished slightly in non-lesional AD and further in controls.

- 2020 Mar - Pavel - [The proteomic skin profile of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis patients shows an inflammatory signature](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaad.2019.10.039) 
  - Lesional vs non-lesional skin and blood 
  - Inflammatory markers (matrix metalloproteinase 12; T-helper cell [Th]2/interleukin [IL]-1 receptor-like 1[IL1RL1]/IL-33R, IL-13, chemokine [C-C motif] ligand [CCL] 17; Th1/C-X-C motif chemokine 10; Th17/Th22/PI3, CCL20, S100A12)
